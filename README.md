- **Intent**: To provide a detailed, actionable guide for developers, covering everything from high-level strategy to granular technical details. It includes practical templates and checklists to ensure a thorough and secure handover.

### 2. `wp-handover/checklist/wp-handoff-checklist.md`

### 3. `wp-handover/simplistic/wp-handoff-indexed.md`
